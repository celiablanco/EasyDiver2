# EasyDIVER 2.0
This is the README document for the EasyDIVER 2.0 pipeline for pre-processing and analyzing HTS reads from _in vitro_ selection experiments. EasyDIVER can be used to process and analyze nucleotides or amino acids sequencing data corresponding to consecutive rounds of in vitro selection and amplification.

Consult the EasyDIVER 2.0 [documentation](https://easydiver2.readthedocs.io/) for detailed information on Installation, Usage and Examples. 

# 

Consult the original EasyDIVER [manual](https://github.com/ichen-lab-ucsb/EasyDIVER/blob/master/MANUAL.pdf) for the pre-processing part of the pipeline. EasyDIVER can be found  

# Input

All input files must be:
    
1. Located in the same directory (even reads from separate lanes).
2. In FASTQ format
3. Named using the standard Illumina naming scheme: sample-name_S#_L00#_R#_001.fastq
4. In either .fastq or .fastq.gz extensions.

# Test dataset

A test dataset is provided. The test data corresponds to two samples obtained from a real experiment of in vitro evolution of mRNA displayed peptides. 
     
# Reporting bugs

Please report any bugs to Celia Blanco (celia.blanco@bmsis.org). 

When reporting bugs, please include the full output printed in the terminal when running the pipeline.
