# EasyDIVER 2.0
This is the README document for the EasyDIVER 2.0 pipeline for pre-processing and analyzing HTS reads from _in vitro_ selection experiments. EasyDIVER can be used to process and analyze nucleotides or amino acids sequencing data corresponding to consecutive rounds of in vitro selection and amplification.

Consult the EasyDIVER 2.0 [documentation](https://easydiver2.readthedocs.io/) for detailed information on Installation, Usage and Examples. 

Consult the original EasyDIVER [documentation and manual](https://github.com/ichen-lab-ucsb/EasyDIVER) for details on the pre-processing part of the pipeline.   

# Test dataset

A test dataset is provided [LINK TBD]. The test data corresponds to two samples obtained from a real experiment of in vitro evolution of mRNA displayed peptides. Instructions on how to run the pipeline for the testdataset can be found in the [documentation](https://easydiver2.readthedocs.io/) for detailed information on Installation, Usage and Examples. 
     
# Reporting bugs

Report any bugs to Celia Blanco (celia.blanco@bmsis.org). 

When reporting bugs, please include the full output printed in the terminal when running the pipeline.
