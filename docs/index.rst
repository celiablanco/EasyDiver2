Introduction
----------------------------

EasyDIVER 2.0 is an improved build of the EasyDIVER tool [LINK]. This tool can be used to accomplish blah blah blah. 
Additionally, for v2.0, the authors have created an application with a GUI that can be run quite simply. 

EasyDIVER 2.0 unlocks a new capability, namely the ability to run Enrichment Analysis on the outputs of EasyDIVER (the `counts` and `counts_aa` folders).
Upon completion of the Enrichment Analysis, the user may also choose to create graphical outputs via a GUI that allows for 
customization of different parameters (and outputs the subsequent graph from each graph generation to a tab in the default web browser).
This graph generating GUI can also be run independently from the main entry point of the GUI-based application, as long as the user already has
run the enrichment analysis and has the subsequent `modified_counts` and `modified_counts_aa` folders in place.
