EasyDiver+
==========

EasyDiver+ is an improved build of the `EasyDIVER tool <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00239-020-09954-0>`_. 
While EasyDIVER was a pipeline exclusively to process paired-end sequencing data, EasyDiver+ can process, analyze and visualize sequencing data from consecutive rounds of in vitro evolution. 

The main improvements in EasyDiver+ compared to the original EasyDIVER are:

* Straightforward, user-friendly GUI.
* Option to analyze sequencing data, calculating metrics for the relative enrichment across consecutive rounds of selection.
* Unique sequence names consistently used across rounds of selection to faciliate visual identification of variants of interest.
* Estimation of 95% confidence intervals for sequence counts.
* Graphical outputs with user defined cutoff values.
